# Variational_Quantum_Algorithms

This repository contains theoretical notes on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA), a class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms designed to leverage the power of quantum computing for solving complex optimization problems and simulating quantum systems. VQAs utilize a parameterized quantum circuit, often referred to as an ansatz, which is trained using classical optimization techniques to minimize a cost function that quantifies the performance of the circuit. By iteratively adjusting the parameters and evaluating the cost function, VQAs can efficiently approximate solutions to problems such as quantum chemistry, optimization, and machine learning tasks. This repository aims to provide insights into the foundational concepts, mathematical formulations, and applications of VQAs, serving as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring the potential of quantum computing.
